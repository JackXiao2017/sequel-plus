/**
 * The Transfer sheet of a PostgreSQL tab (the Transfer toolbar item), built in code: copies this tab's database (the
 * whole of it, or some tables with what they need) into a database of any Postgres favorite, through SPPostgresTransfer.
 *
 * - Scope: "Whole database “<db>”" (default) or "Selected tables" (a checkbox list grouped by schema, preset to the
 *   sidebar's selected table).
 * - To: a favorite (the first that isn't this tab's is preselected), the line under it showing user@host:port,
 *   user@<socket directory> or user@host:port via SSH sshUser@sshHost. Choosing a favorite (and opening the sheet)
 *   opens a session to it (the favorite's database, or postgres; one retry on postgres) with the Keychain password,
 *   asking for one (never saved) when the server wants it. Database: a menu of the session's databases, then
 *   "New Database…" (CREATE DATABASE on the session); the favorite's database is selected when listed, else none. "Connecting…" / "Not connected" (the error and Retry under it).
 * - Mode: "Empty the target database first" (default; confirmed first by typing the database's name, except for a
 *   database created in this sheet) or "Overwrite tables that already exist on the target".
 *
 * The transfer runs as a two-connection SPPostgresBackgroundJob (this tab's database from the document's provider,
 * then the target, opened through the session: its SSH tunnel and password) under an SPPostgresProgressSheet. Cancel
 * interrupts both. The session closes when the controller finishes. The outcome is shown as an alert (the document's
 * alertPresenter when set): "Transfer complete", or why the target wasn't changed. Use on the main thread.
