/**
 * The Content view of a PostgreSQL tab, laid out as MySQL's Content tab: a filter bar on top (column,
 * comparison, value, Filter; shown or hidden by filterToggleButton, see toggleFilterBar:), the rows in an SPTableView, and MySQL's bottom bar (see addButton). ⌫ or ⌦ in the
 * grid deletes the selected rows (see removeRows:). Built in code.
 * Use on the main thread.
 *
 * Rows come from SPPostgresTableData as PostgreSQL text. The page size is MySQL's "Limit results"
 * preference (unlimited when it is off); NULL is shown as MySQL's NULL placeholder preference, in grey.
 * Header clicks sort ascending, then descending, from the first page. Cells are edited as text, in place or, in edit
 * mode (see toggleEditMode:), in the field editor sheet: ending an edit updates the row on the server. Tables without a
 * primary key, views and generated columns are never edited.
 *
 * A data-layer error is shown as an alert (see alertPresenter); the grid keeps the rows it showed.
 *
 * Loads run through taskRunner: with the tab's background runner a load method returns at once and the end state it
 * documents holds once the runner is idle; a cancelled load shows no alert and keeps what was shown (a cancelled
 * table switch shows the new table's columns, if they came, without rows; Refresh loads it). The short writes (a cell
 * edit, add, duplicate, delete) run on the main thread and are refused (NSBeep) while the runner is busy.
