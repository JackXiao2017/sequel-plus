/**
 * The Users sheet of a PostgreSQL tab, built in code: the cluster's roles (logins and groups, the predefined pg_*
 * roles hidden) on the left with +, − and duplicate; on the right a tab view with General (the role's name,
 * password, expiry, connection limit and attributes), Membership ("Member of:" and "Members of this role:") and
 * Privileges (per database and schema). Every edit is a draft until Apply, which sends the role changes and every
 * database-level grant in one transaction on the document's database, then each database's other privilege changes
 * in a transaction of their own on that database (the document's first, then the others by name). When everything
 * succeeds the sheet closes; on a failure it stays open with the error and every edit not applied (after a failure
 * in a later database it re-reads what was saved). Cancel discards everything.
 *
 * It never uses the document's connection: it asks `provider` for connections of its own (to the document's
 * database first), and disconnects them (and the connectors it adopted) when the sheet ends. Use on the main thread.
