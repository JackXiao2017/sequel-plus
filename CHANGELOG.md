# Changelog

## Sequel Plus 2.0.1

Upgrading from 2.0.0.

### Table list shows table sizes
- Each table in the table list shows its size after its name, aligned right in a lighter color. A long name is shortened with "…" before the size.
- The size matches a figure in the Table Information pane:
  - **MySQL:** "size:", the table's data without its indexes (`DATA_LENGTH` from `information_schema.TABLES`). MySQL 8 may cache these figures, so a size can lag behind recent changes, as in Table Information.
  - **PostgreSQL:** "total size:", the table's data, TOAST and indexes (`pg_total_relation_size`).
- Sizes move up a unit at 1024 of the smaller one. From 1024 MB they are shown in GB with one decimal, "1.5 GiB" (MySQL) or "1.5 GB" (PostgreSQL), and from 1024 GB in TB.

### PostgreSQL: sizes written in kB from 1 kB
- PostgreSQL's own size format (`pg_size_pretty`) stays in bytes up to 10 kB and in MB up to 10 GB, so a one-page table showed as "8192 bytes". The table list and Table Info (size, index size and total size, in both the Table Info tab and the sidebar's info pane) now write sizes themselves:
  - under 1 kB in bytes ("0 bytes");
  - then whole kB and MB up to 1023 ("8 kB", "17 MB");
  - from 1024 MB, GB with one decimal ("1.5 GB"), and from 1024 GB, TB.
- Views, procedures, functions and sequences show no size. In PostgreSQL a partitioned table shows none either; each partition shows its own.
- Sizes are read when the list loads or is refreshed. If the server doesn't allow reading them, the list shows names only, as before.

### Filter for the favorites list
- A **Filter** field above the connection screen's favorites list. As you type, the list shows only the MySQL and PostgreSQL favorites whose name or host contains the text (ignoring case and accents), with the groups they are in expanded. Typing a group's name shows everything in that group.
- The selected favorite stays in the list while filtering, and the form keeps what it shows. Quick Connect is always shown.
- Clearing the field shows the whole list again, with groups expanded or collapsed as you left them.
- While filtering, favorites can't be dragged to new places. Adding a favorite or group clears the filter, so the new item is visible.

### PostgreSQL: adding a row to a table with a required column
- **Fixed:** in Content, **Add row** (+) on a table with a NOT NULL column that has no default failed at once ("null value in column … violates not-null constraint"). It inserted the row before you could type anything.
- On such a table the new row is now added in the grid only, as MySQL does, and editing starts in the first required column. The row is inserted when you leave it: Return, selecting another row, adding another row, refreshing, sorting, filtering or changing page. Only the values you typed are sent; the other columns get their defaults.
- If the insert fails (e.g. a required value is still missing), the error is shown and the row stays, with what you typed, so you can finish it. Deleting the new row (−) just removes it, with nothing sent to the server.
- Tables without a required column work as before: the row is inserted at once with every column's default.

### PostgreSQL: Truncate can restart identity
- The **Truncate Table** question has a **Restart identity** checkbox, off by default. Checked, the truncate also resets the counters of the tables' serial and identity columns (`TRUNCATE … RESTART IDENTITY`), so new rows are numbered from the start again. Unchecked, numbering carries on, as before.

### PostgreSQL: the table information pane shows every line
- The **TABLE INFORMATION** pane under the table list is now tall enough for all its lines: type, owner, rows, size, index size, total size and comment. It was fixed at MySQL's 166 pt, which cut off **total size** and **comment**.

### Query's run button shows its whole title (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- The run button above the results (**Run Current**, **Run Previous**, **Run Selection**, **Run All**) shows its full title, centred. It was cut off ("Run Curre…") because the button kept room for the menu's ⌘R and ⌥⌘R shortcuts.

### PostgreSQL: Add Database and Refresh Databases in the database selector
- The toolbar's database selector is laid out as MySQL's: **Choose Database...**, then **Add Database...** and **Refresh Databases**, then the databases.
  - **Add Database...** asks for the name, creates the database and switches to it, as Database ▸ Add Database… does.
  - **Refresh Databases** reads the list again.
  - Choosing any of these keeps the tab in its database, which the selector shows again.

### Databases in the database selector (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- **Show all databases**, a new checkbox under the Database field in the connection editor, for MySQL and PostgreSQL, on every connection tab. It is on by default, and for favorites saved before it.
  - **On:** the toolbar's database selector lists every database you can use, as before.
  - **Off:** it lists only the connection's database (MySQL also lists the database in use, after a `USE`). The Database field must then be filled: Connect, Test Connection, Save Changes and Add to Favorites ask for it, and its placeholder says "required".
  - Clicking it is an edit of the connection, like typing in a field: Save Changes, Add to Favorites and Test Connection appear.
  - It is saved with the favorite, and is on for Quick Connect.
- PostgreSQL: the database selector, and Transfer's database lists, now leave out databases you have no CONNECT privilege on, whether granted directly, through a role, or through PUBLIC. Superusers still see every database. (MySQL's list already shows only databases you have a privilege on.)

### PostgreSQL: TABLES expanded in the sidebar
- The sidebar's **TABLES** is now expanded in a new connection tab, and after choosing another database or schema or refreshing. Views, Sequences and Extensions still start collapsed.
- After choosing a database or schema, or refreshing, the other sections keep the state you left them in.

### PostgreSQL: copying rows, and a right-click menu in the grids
- **Right-click menu**, as MySQL's, in Content's grid and in Query's results. Right-clicking a row selects it first.
  - **Content:** Copy, Copy with Column Names, Copy as SQL INSERT, Add New Row, Duplicate Row and Delete Row. The row items are enabled as the bottom bar's buttons are: Duplicate Row needs exactly one selected row.
  - **Query results:** Copy, Copy with Column Names and Copy as SQL INSERT.
- **Edit ▸ Copy** (⌘C) and **Copy with Column Names** (⌥⌘C) copy the selected rows as tab-separated text, as in MySQL. A line per row, with the column names' line first for Copy with Column Names. NULL is shown as the NULL placeholder from Preferences, and line breaks and tabs inside a value become ↵ and ⇥. Query results copy whole values. There is no paste.
- **Edit ▸ Copy as SQL INSERT** (⌃⌥⌘C) now works in Content's grid and in Query's results, as in MySQL. It copies the selected rows as one INSERT statement, with a VALUES line per row:
  ```
  INSERT INTO "public"."items" ("id", "name")
  VALUES
  	('1', 'first'),
  	('2', NULL);
  ```
  - Columns are in the order shown, with names in double quotes. Values are quoted text, which PostgreSQL converts to each column's type; NULL stays NULL.
  - **Content:** the rows go into the table being shown. Generated columns are left out, since PostgreSQL refuses values for them.
  - **Query results:** whole values are copied, not the shortened ones shown in the grid. The rows go into the table every column comes from, or `<table>` when they come from several tables or from none, as in MySQL.

### App
- Version **2.0.1**.

## Sequel Plus 2.0.0

Upgrading from 2.0.0-RC4.

### Separate from Sequel Pro
- Sequel Plus has its own app ID, `com.sequelplus.SequelPlus`, so its settings are kept apart from Sequel Pro's.
- Its data (favorites, query history, bundles, themes, saved Query texts) is kept in `~/Library/Application Support/Sequel Plus`.
- Its saved passwords are kept in the keychain as "Sequel Plus : …", "Sequel Plus SSHTunnel : …" and "Sequel Plus (PostgreSQL) : …".
- The first launch copies everything over once:
  - Sequel Pro's settings;
  - its `~/Library/Application Support/Sequel Pro` folder, which includes the data of the RC builds;
  - each saved password, to a new "Sequel Plus" keychain item. macOS asks to allow each one; choose **Always Allow**.
- Sequel Pro's settings, folder and keychain items are only read, never changed. Afterwards the two apps don't share anything.

### New for MySQL and PostgreSQL connections

#### Query editor keeps its SQL
- The Query editor's text is saved for each connection as you type (about a second after you stop), when the tab closes and when the app quits.
- Connecting again fills an empty Query editor with that connection's saved text. Text from an `.spf` file or **Open in New Tab** is never replaced.
- A saved favorite has its own text, kept when the favorite is renamed or edited. A Quick Connect is matched by its host, port and user (and socket or SSH host).
- Emptying the editor deletes the saved text. Two tabs on the same connection share it: the last one saved wins.
- The texts are kept in `~/Library/Application Support/Sequel Plus/Data/Query Scripts/`, one `.sql` file per connection.

### PostgreSQL connections
- **Add Schema** (the **+** after the schema pop-up) also asks for the owner: a pop-up of the server's roles, with the connected user selected.
- A pencil button before the **+** edits the shown schema's owner. **Save** changes it; if the server refuses, its message is shown.
- With the **Database** field empty, a connection opens the `postgres` database. Before, it tried a database named after the user, which often doesn't exist.
- Fixed: a favorite just added with the favorites **+** button, switched to PostgreSQL in the form, moved to Quick Connect. It now becomes a PostgreSQL favorite, stays selected and keeps what was typed. Other saved MySQL favorites still move their details to Quick Connect when switched.

### Favorites
- MySQL and PostgreSQL favorites are now saved together, in one favorites file (`Favorites.plist`). Groups, sorting and drag and drop work the same for both.
- On first launch the PostgreSQL favorites of RC4 are moved into it, each where it was shown. The old `PostgresFavorites.plist` and `PostgresFavoritePlacements.plist` are kept as backups, renamed with `.imported` at the end.
- Favorites export, favorites import and the **Default favorite** pop-up stay MySQL-only.

### App
- Version **2.0.0**.

### Readme
- The readme's logo and screenshot are now in the repository's `images/` folder instead of on Sequel Pro's website:
  - `Sequel-Plus-icon-512.png`, the app icon;
  - `Sequel-Plus.png`, the connection screen with MySQL and PostgreSQL favorites in one list.

### Unchanged
- **MySQL:** connecting to and working with a MySQL server is unchanged. What's new for MySQL is listed above: the Query editor keeps its SQL, and MySQL favorites share `Favorites.plist` and the separate Sequel Plus data and passwords.
- **Your data:** favorites, saved settings, passwords and data are carried over from RC4 (see "Separate from Sequel Pro").
- **Updates:** checking for updates stays off.

## Sequel Plus 2.0.0-RC4

Upgrading from 2.0.0-RC3.

### New for PostgreSQL connections

#### Table list
- A **+** button after the schema pop-up adds a schema: enter its name and it's created in the open database, then shown. If the server refuses (for example, the schema already exists), its message is shown.
- A **Filter** field under the schema pop-up shows only the tables, views, sequences and extensions whose names contain what you type. **Table ▸ Filter Tables** moves the cursor to it.
- **TABLES**, **VIEWS**, **SEQUENCES** and **EXTENSIONS** can be collapsed and expanded. Each heading has its arrow at the front, always shown.
- Every section starts collapsed when a schema opens. Selecting a table from elsewhere (history, Open Table in New Tab) opens its section.

#### Database menu
The Database menu now works for PostgreSQL connections:
- **Go to Database…**, **Refresh Tables**, **Refresh Databases** and **Open Database in New Tab**.
- **Add Database…** creates a database, then opens it.
- **Rename Database…** and **Duplicate Database…** work on the open database.
- **Delete Database…** permanently deletes the open database. You confirm by typing its name.
- **Alter Database…** changes the open database's name, owner and comment.
- **Show Server Variables…** lists the server's settings, with a filter.
- **Show Server Processes…** lists the server's sessions. **Cancel Query** stops a session's running statement and **Kill Connection** ends the session; your own session can't be stopped.
- PostgreSQL won't rename, copy or delete a database while anyone is connected to it. For those three, the window first moves to another database (`postgres` when it can), then makes the change. If another session is connected, the server refuses and its message is shown.
- **Flush Privileges**, **View Using Encoding** and **Shutdown Server** stay disabled: PostgreSQL has nothing equivalent.

#### Structure
- A new bar above the columns list holds an **Owner** pop-up, at its left, that changes the table's owner. It lists the server's roles.
- Fixed: after choosing another table, its columns could stay greyed out, as if they couldn't be edited, until something else redrew the list.

#### Date and time picker
- Editing a `date`, `time`, `timetz`, `timestamp` or `timestamptz` cell in Content or in a Query result opens a picker on the cell: a calendar for the date, a time stepper for the time, and a text field with the value.
- Picking writes the value into the text field; you can still type there (for `infinity`, fractions of a second, another offset, …). **Today** or **Now** fills in the current date or time.
- **Set** doesn't save to the database: it puts the value into the cell, which stays in edit mode. Press Return to save it or Escape to drop it, as with any cell edit. **NULL** (when the column allows it) puts NULL in the cell the same way. **Cancel** or Escape in the picker leaves the cell as it was.
- A value with a time zone keeps its offset, such as `+08:00`.

#### Query editor completion
- After `alias.` the editor suggests the columns of the table or view that alias stands for, as in `FROM orders a`, `JOIN items AS i` or `FROM public.orders o`. Before, it listed every table.
- After a table's name (`orders.`) it suggests that table's columns. After the shown schema's name (`public.`) it suggests its tables and views.
- Plain suggestions also include the columns of every table the current statement names.

### New for MySQL connections

#### Date and time picker
- Double-clicking a `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP` cell in Content or in a Custom Query result opens the same picker as for PostgreSQL. `YEAR` cells still edit as text.
- **Set** puts the value into the cell, which stays in edit mode; it is saved the way any cell edit is. **NULL** appears when the column allows NULL.
- Values the picker can't read, such as `0000-00-00` or a `TIME` over 24 hours, stay as they are in the text field.
- A cell that can't be edited (for example a Custom Query row that doesn't match exactly one row) opens no picker and behaves as before. Edit-in-sheet mode still uses the field editor sheet for every cell.

### App
- Version **2.0.0-RC4**.

### Unchanged
- **MySQL:** apart from the date and time picker, no changes to MySQL connections.
- **Your data:** favorites, saved settings and data are kept from RC3.
- **App icon:** the same as RC3.
- **Bundle ID and data folder:** the app keeps the same bundle ID and the same `~/Library/Application Support/Sequel Pro` folder.
- **Updates:** checking for updates stays off.

## Sequel Plus 2.0.0-RC3

Upgrading from 2.0.0-RC2. Every PostgreSQL feature is now available. These buttons, menu items and table list sections were disabled or hidden in RC2.

### New for PostgreSQL connections

#### Transfer
- Copies selected tables, or a whole database, from the current server to another PostgreSQL server. The target is usually a saved favorite and can use its own SSH tunnel.
- You choose one of two modes:
  - **Empty the target database first.** This removes everything inside the target database: all schemas (including `public`), tables, views, functions, types and extensions. You confirm by typing the target database's name. Other databases on that server are never touched.
  - **Overwrite tables that already exist.** Copied tables that already exist on the target are replaced, and the target's other tables are left alone. If replacing a table would break something on the target, such as a view or a foreign key from a table not being copied, Transfer stops before changing anything and lists what's in the way.
- Indexes, constraints, defaults and owned sequences are copied with the tables.

#### Users
- Manages roles the PostgreSQL way: logins and groups in one list. You can add, remove and duplicate roles.
- **General:** name, password, valid-until, connection limit, and the LOGIN, INHERIT, SUPERUSER, CREATEDB, CREATEROLE, REPLICATION and BYPASSRLS attributes.
- **Membership:** the roles this role belongs to (optionally WITH ADMIN OPTION), and the roles that belong to it.
- **Privileges:** pick a database and schema, then grant or revoke per object:
  - databases: CONNECT, CREATE, TEMP
  - schemas: USAGE, CREATE
  - tables: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, REFERENCES, TRIGGER
  - sequences: USAGE, SELECT
  - functions: EXECUTE
- You can also set default privileges for objects created later in the schema.
- Changes are applied together with **Apply**, as in the MySQL User Manager.

#### Sequences
- The table list shows a **SEQUENCES** section.
- Select a sequence to edit its name, type, start, increment, minimum, maximum, cache, cycle, owning column and comment. Its owner and current value are also shown.
- **Set Value…** sets the current value.
- **Add Sequence** and **Delete Sequence** are in the right-click and gear menus.

#### Extensions
- The table list shows an **EXTENSIONS** section with the extensions installed in the current database.
- You can install one of the server's available extensions, change an installed extension's version, or drop an extension.

#### Table history
- The toolbar's **Back/Forward** buttons and **View ▸ Back/Forward In History** move between the tables and views you've visited, as they do for MySQL. This also works across databases.

#### Create Syntax
- **Show Create Table Syntax…** and **Copy Create Table Syntax** in the table list's right-click and gear menus.

### App
- Version **2.0.0-RC3**.

### Unchanged
- **MySQL:** no changes to MySQL connections.
- **Your data:** favorites, saved settings and data are kept from RC2.
- **Bundle ID and data folder:** the app keeps the same bundle ID and the same `~/Library/Application Support/Sequel Pro` folder.
- **Updates:** checking for updates stays off.

## Sequel Plus 2.0.0-RC2

Upgrading from 2.0.0-RC1.

### New for PostgreSQL connections

These toolbar buttons were already visible in RC1 but disabled. They now work, along with their View menu items and shortcuts.

#### Structure
- See a table's columns, indexes and constraints, and edit them in place with the + and − buttons.
- **Columns:**
  - Add a column with its name, type (with length or precision), default, NOT NULL, identity/serial and comment.
  - Rename a column, change its type, change its default, set or drop NOT NULL, edit its comment, or delete it.
  - If existing data won't convert to the new type, the server's error is shown with a conversion expression (`USING column::newtype`) that you can edit and retry.
- **Indexes and constraints:** add and drop indexes, primary keys, and unique, check and foreign-key constraints.
- **Table:** rename it and edit its comment.
- PostgreSQL can't reorder columns, so there is no drag-to-reorder.

#### Relations
- See a table's foreign keys.
- Add and remove them.

#### Triggers
- See a table's triggers and the functions they call.
- Add and remove triggers.

#### Table Info
- Shows the table's owner, row estimate, table, index and total sizes, its comment, and its CREATE statement.

#### Import and Export
- **File ▸ Export…** exports a database, schemas or selected tables as an SQL dump or as CSV.
  - The SQL dump is generated by Sequel Plus itself, so `pg_dump` is not needed. It works with PostgreSQL 12–18.
  - The table list's **Export** menu and the Query view's **Export Result** (CSV) work too.
- **File ▸ Import…** imports an SQL dump or a CSV file.
  - SQL dumps can be Sequel Plus's own or plain-format `pg_dump` files, including their `COPY … FROM stdin` data.
  - CSV can go into an existing table, with column mapping and the delimiter, quote, header-row and NULL options.
  - Custom, directory and tar `pg_dump` formats aren't supported.

#### Duplicate Table
- **Duplicate Table…** in the table list's right-click menu copies a table, optionally with its contents.
- It already worked in RC1; it is listed here because it is part of this release's feature set.

### App
- The About window shows the app name as **Sequel Plus**.
- When no database is connected, the window and tab title read **Sequel Plus** instead of "Sequel Pro".
- The copyright notice now reads "Copyright 2026-2026 Sequel Plus."
- Version **2.0.0-RC2**.

### Still not available for PostgreSQL in RC2

These buttons and menu items are still shown disabled or hidden:
- Sequences and Extensions in the table list
- Users
- Transfer
- Back/forward table history
- Show/Copy Create Syntax

### Unchanged
- **MySQL:** no changes to MySQL connections.
- **Your data:** favorites, saved settings and data are kept from RC1.
- **Bundle ID and data folder:** the app keeps the same bundle ID and the same `~/Library/Application Support/Sequel Pro` folder.
- **Updates:** checking for updates stays off.
